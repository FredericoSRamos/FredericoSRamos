### Hey there! 👋

I'm **Frederico**, a Full Stack Software Engineer based in **Rio de Janeiro**.

My goal is simple: **to build software that creates real impact.**

If there’s a complex problem, I’ll most likely want to architect a solution for it.

My technical foundation is strong in **.NET (C#)** and **React/TypeScript**, but I consider myself **technology-agnostic**: I use the right tool for the job. I have solid experience with architecture (DDD, layered design), infrastructure (AWS, Docker, K8s), and I’m a big fan of the JetBrains suite for development.

I have several projects here, but I have a special affection for [WeatherForecast](https://github.com/FredericoSRamos/WeatherForecast). Even though it’s not the most complex and I’ve grown a lot since then, it’s still my favorite.

Right now, I’m focused on improving distributed systems and creating fluid interfaces.

### About Me:

* 👾 **Tryhard gamer:** I love Metroidvanias (especially the hard ones) and I’m a completionist, getting 100% in games is my thing.
* 😁 **Joy!:** I’m naturally a happy and optimistic person. I believe a calm mind leads to better code.
